#### Sample text
> So this is it.
 All you have to do to use is to clone it or download it and open the **index.html** file.
 As my first medium/complicated (kind of) project I think I did pretty good (with the logic), but I think my code can be inproved so much more.
 I will continue to participate in the coding challenges from my comunity and have fun and learn new things.
