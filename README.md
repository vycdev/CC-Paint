#### Sample text

> So this is it.
> All you have to do to use is to clone it or download it and open the **index.html** file.
> As my first medium/complicated (kind of) project I think I did pretty good (with the logic), but I think my code can be inproved so much more.
> I will continue to participate in the coding challenges from my comunity and have fun and learn new things.

### Developing:

Install the "prettier" visual studio code extension. This will allow vsc to read the ".prettierrc" file and beautify your code on save!
